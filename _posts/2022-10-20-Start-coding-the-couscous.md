Setting up rust is not the easiest thing in my day.

This might come as a shock to no-one: I'm not a rust developer. Setting up what I need to be able to write firmware for the couscous have not been the smooth sailing I was hoping for. I know what I want to do in rust (kinda), but setting up an environment where I can actually write embedded rust with HID has not been the easiest I've done.

But, challenge is nice. I suppose. I like Rust based on my adventures with it in Advent of Code. So I really want to get better at it. And if it can get me out of Arduino-C I will be quite glad.

But for now, the Rust environment will have to wait till the weekend.
