I'm moving all my stuff to GitHub pages!

There are some reasons for this
  1) It's nice to keep it where I have all my other projects
  2) Version control!
  3) Free, easy, and jekyll seems nice
  4) Kinda pushed to it from the Seeed Fusion competition

For someone reading this not knowing where I went from: I was hosting my own server and using just plain text files to write my ramblings. With this setup I can shut that down and stop exposing my home server to the world.

I won't migrate things. They will get to live where they are behind locked doors. They are of no use to anyone but me anyway. The only exception is the couscous project. That one needs to be exposed to the world. But it's not migrated as-is. I've made it prettier'n'stuff. Pictures.

I couldn't find a jekyll theme I liked unfortunately. I've tried to set up this page for some days (look at the commits if you want to see) but nothing really fit *me*. So doing everything myself (*oh, how unusual qwelyt, doing things yourself again*) to get it the way I want it. This means I will run into all sorts of "fun" problems that others have already solved way better than I can. Oh well, jank is my life.
