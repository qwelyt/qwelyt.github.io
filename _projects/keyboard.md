one_liner: First keyboard I designed and coded

The creatively named "Keyboard" is a keyboard. Who would have guessed?  

62 keys split into two halves. One with 30 keys and one with 32.

It is actually two keyboards. Each halve is its own keyboard and does not communicate with the other halve. So if you want a gaming halve, this works. Just plug in the left one and leave the right one on the shelve. Will be hard to trash talk though.

The "brains" are arduino micros (not proMicro, plain micro) and are coded in Arduino-C. They are still recognised as arduinos which makes them discoverable by the ArduinoIDE without having to do anything special.
